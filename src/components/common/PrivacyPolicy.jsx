    HIPAA was enacted to help establish national standards for EMRs, especially in relation to funding of healthcare services and protection of the information held by covered entities. In an effort to better understand HIPAA and its relation to the camp setting, two components need to be defined:
    Covered entity: any person, business, or agency that furnishes, bills, or receives payment for healthcare in the normal course of business and transmits any covered transactions electronically.
    Covered transaction: transactions for which standards (45 C.F.R. Part 162) have been adopted. These transactions involve:
    a. health care claims
    b. eligibility for a health plan
    c. referral certification and authorization
    d. health care claim status inquiry/response
    e. enrollment or disenrollment in a health plan
    f. health care payment and remittance advice
    g. health plan premium payment transaction
    h. coordination of benefits transaction

    healthEcamper is not regulated by HIPAA for the following reasons.
    healthEcamper doesnot store or share your data with health care providers.
    healthEcamper stores data on behalf of the user (parents/guardians)
